        <p>Everything is bigger in the state of Texas. We mainly have dry and deserty areas but also lots of water such as rivers, lakes, and ocean. The cowboy culture is big here and just as good as our BBQ! The food is influenced by our neighbors in the south (Mexico), that's where the great TEX-MEX food was born. Come and bring you cowboy hat and boots and enjoy Texas</p>
